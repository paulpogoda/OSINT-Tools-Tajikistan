# OSINT-Tools-Tajikistan
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Flag_of_Tajikistan.svg" alt="Flag of Tajikistan"/>

Here is a list of OSINT tools that may be useful to you when conducting investigations related to Tajikistan. If you want to add something, that's great! Please make a pull request or message me on Telegram.
Unless further clarified, the site or project has main version in Tajik and Russian. To use a part of them you need a registration or tax identification number. So for deeper OSINT, you have to find a friend in Tajikistan. Have you ever been there? Oh! Then you should [visit Dushanbe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293964-Activities-Dushanbe.html) or [Khujand](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g811256-Activities-Khujand_Sughd_Province.html).

NB: There is a leak of open data in Tajikistan, even for residents. However, some data that is not available on official Tajik sources can be found in international sources. See the appendix.
